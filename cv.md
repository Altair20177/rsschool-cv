I study at BSUIR. Now i'm second course. I have a goal: i want to be demanded programmer and highly-paid specialist. Never worked in my speciality, but want to find a job in the third course. Like volleyball very much. And always ready to learn something new.

I know only one language: C++ and a bit JS and Pascal. Use Visual Studio and VSCode. At an early date I will learn MySQL.

This is a block with some code, where I show what I can in markdown: here I can use *italics* or **bold**, above i used list and headers.

In the first and second courses I passed and defended two course works in C++.
Study in BSUIR, once I was in seminar in EPAM. And never visited vebinars.
My English level is A2-B1. Finished English courses in BSUIR and don't have any practise in English-speaking coutries.

### This is the end of my CV.
